You must install the Android SDK in order to build the Java APK. The Android SDK can be downloaded
from

http://code.google.com/android/download.html

Build Steps:

1) Create an Eclipse project to for the Java code.

	Launch Eclipse
	Choose File : New : Project...
	Choose Android : Android Project
	Choose Next
	Enter "JNIExample" into the Project name: field.
	Choose "Create project from existing source"
	Click the Browse button and browse to the pndk/samplejni directory
	
	Click Finish

2) Build the Eclipse Project

	Select the JNIExample project in the Package Explorer
	Make sure that the menu item Project:Build Automatically is not checked.
	Choose Project:Build

    The resulting apk file ends up in bin/full/JNIExample.apk

2) Build the shared library, insert the shared library into the APK file and resign the
    shared library.

    ANDROID_SDK_BASE=<directory where SDK is installed> make

Install the APK on the device:

	adb install -r bin/full/JNIExample.apk

Once the application is installed, you can run it by tapping on the "JNI Example" icon.
