This directory contains the source for the source.android.com site contents.
The Platform Development Kit (PDK, a set of tools for the convenience of
engineers doing building devices) is also built as part of the site build.

Subdirectories include:
  about -- general information about the Android Open Source Project
  community -- information about the AOSP mailing lists
  compatibility -- information about building compatible devices
  downloads -- links to download files of interest
  images -- images used in docs; note: this is NOT for UI assets/skins
  porting -- tips & guides for porting the Android source to hardware
  source -- how to access & use the Android source

This directory originated as the PDK home (hence the name) and grew to
encompass source.android.com.
