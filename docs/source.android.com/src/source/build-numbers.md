# Codenames, Tags, and Build Numbers #

At a high level, Android development happens around families of
releases, which use code names ordered alphabetically after tasty
treats.

## Platform code names, versions, API levels, and NDK releases ##

The code names match the following version numbers, along with
API levels and NDK releases provided for convenience:

Code name      | Version      | API level
---------------|--------------|------------
(no code name) | 1.0          | API level 1
(no code name) | 1.1          | API level 2
Cupcake        | 1.5          | API level 3, NDK 1
Donut          | 1.6          | API level 4, NDK 2
Eclair         | 2.0          | API level 5
Eclair         | 2.0.1        | API level 6
Eclair         | 2.1 (incl. 2.1-update 1) | API level 7, NDK 3
Froyo          | 2.2.x        | API level 8, NDK 4
Gingerbread    | 2.3 - 2.3.2  | API level 9, NDK 5
Gingerbread    | 2.3.3 - 2.3.7            | API level 10
Honeycomb      | 3.0                      | API level 11
Honeycomb      | 3.1                      | API level 12
Honeycomb      | 3.2 - 3.2.2              | API level 13

Starting with Cupcake, individual builds are identified with a short
build code, e.g. FRF85B.

The first letter is the code name of the release family, e.g. F is
Froyo.

The second letter is a branch code that allows Google to identify
the exact code branch that the build was made from, and R is by
convention the primary release branch.

The next letter and two digits are a date code. The letter counts
quarters, with A being Q1 2009. Therefore, F is Q2 2010. The two
digits count days within the quarter, so F85 is June 24 2010.

Finally, the last letter identifies individual versions related to
the same date code, sequentially starting with A; A is actually
implicit and usually omitted for brevity.

The date code is not guaranteed to be the exact date at which a build
was made, and it is common that minor variations added to an existing
build re-use the same date code as that existing build.

## Source code tags and builds ##

Starting with Donut, the exact list of tags and builds is in the
following table:

Build  | Tag                | Notes

DRD20  | android-1.6_r1.4
DMD64  | android-1.6_r1.5   | latest Donut version
ESD20  | android-2.0_r1     | earliest Eclair version
ESD56  | android-2.0.1_r1
ERD79  | android-2.1_r1     | Nexus One
ERE27  | android-2.1_r2     | Nexus One
EPE54B | android-2.1_r2.1p  | Nexus One

FRG83  | android-2.2.1_r1   | Nexus One
FRG83D | android-2.2.1_r2   | Nexus One
FRG83G | android-2.2.2_r1   | latest Froyo version, Nexus One
GRH55  | android-2.3_r1     | earliest Gingerbread version, Nexus S
GRH78  | android-2.3.1_r1   | Nexus S
GRH78C | android-2.3.2_r1   | Nexus S
GRI40  | android-2.3.3_r1   | Nexus One, Nexus S
GRI54  | android-2.3.3_r1.1 | Nexus S
GRJ06D | android-2.3.4_r0.9 | Nexus S 4G
GRJ22  | android-2.3.4_r1   | Nexus One, Nexus S, Nexus S 4G
GRJ90  | android-2.3.5_r1   | Nexus S 4G
GRK39C | android-2.3.6_r0.9 | Nexus S
GRK39F | android-2.3.6_r1   | Nexus One, Nexus S
GWK74  | android-2.3.7_r1   | latest Gingerbread version, Nexus S 4G

The branches donut, eclair, froyo, gingerbread represent development
branches that do not exactly match configurations that were tested
by Google. They might contain a variety of changes in addition to
the official tagged releases, and those haven't been as thoroughly
tested.

## Honeycomb GPL modules ##

For Honeycomb, the entire platform source code isn't available.
However, the parts of Honeycomb licensed under the GPL and LGPL
are available under the following tags:

Build  | Tag                | Notes
-------|--------------------|-----------------------------------
HRI39  | android-3.0_r1     | earliest Honeycomb version
HRI66  | android-3.0_r1.1
HWI69  | android-3.0_r1.2
HRI93  | android-3.0_r1.3
HMJ37  | android-3.1_r1
HTJ85B | android-3.2_r1
HTK55D | android-3.2.1_r1
HTK75D | android-3.2.1_r2
HLK75C | android-3.2.2_r1
HLK75D | android-3.2.2_r2   | latest Honeycomb version

There is no manifest that contains exactly those. However, there
are manifests that allow building those components. The following
commands work for 3.0_r1.1, and using other versions can be done by
switching the git checkout paramater, and if necessary the -m parameter in
repo init. The git checkout command outputs an error for the non-GPL
projects, where it can't find the tag in question.

    $ repo init -b master -m base-for-3.0-gpl.xml
    $ repo sync
    $ repo forall -c git checkout android-3.0_r1.1
