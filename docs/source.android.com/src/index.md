### Compatibility Definition for Android 2.3 ###

The Compatibility Definition Document for Android 2.3.3 has been published. 
Android 2.3 allows device manufacturers to use the Android source code to ship
a significantly wider variety of devices, including devices with extra-large
screens, such as tablets. Android 2.3.3 adds enhanced Near-Field
Communications support to the Android APIs. For more information, visit the 
[Compatibility](compatibility/index.html) page.

### Source Code Available for Android 2.3 ###

The source code for the Android 2.3 platform and software stack has been
released! This release allows OEMs to begin preparing Android 2.3 for
installation on new and existing devices, and allows hobbyists, enthusiasts,
and researchers to develop custom builds. For information on how to obtain the
software, visit our [Getting the Source](source/downloading.html) page.

Here you can find the information and source code you need to build an
Android-compatible device.

Android is an open-source software stack for mobile devices, and a
corresponding open-source project led by Google. We created Android in
response to our own experiences launching mobile apps. We wanted to make
sure that there was no central point of failure, so that no industry player
can restrict or control the innovations of any other.  That's why we
created Android, and made its source code open.
