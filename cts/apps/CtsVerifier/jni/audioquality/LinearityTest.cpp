/* This test accepts a collection of N speech waveforms collected as
   part of N recognition attempts.  The waveforms are ordered by
   increasing presentation level.  The test determines the extent to
   which the peak amplitudes in the waveforms track the change in
   presentation level.  Failure to track the presentation level within
   some reasonable margin is an indication of clipping or of automatic
   gain control in the signal path.

   The speech stimuli that are used for this test should simply be
   replications of exactly the same speech signal presented at
   different levels.  It is expected that all recognition attempts on
   this signal result in correct recognition.  A warning, but not a
   hard failure, should be issued if any of the attempts fail.  The
   hard failure criterion for this test should be only based on the
   amplitude linearity tracking. */
